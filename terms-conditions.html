            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to refresh the world, and we can’t do that without your trust, so we’re providing you with the information below to show you exactly what data we collect from you and how we use that data to deliver the best, most refreshing experience we can. 

 

                This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through activities that link to this Privacy Policy including websites (our “Websites”) and any mobile sites, applications, widgets, and other mobile interactive features (collectively, our “Apps”), through other services that we may offer in connections with our Websites and Apps, such as promotions, rewards programs, through our official social media pages that we control (our “Social Media Pages”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you (collectively, including the Social Media Pages, Apps and Websites, the “Sites”).  
                
                 
                
                By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to and explicitly consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
                
                 
                
                We take privacy seriously, but more importantly, we take our relationship with you seriously.</p>

        <div class="term-2">
            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>“Personal Information” generally means any information that identifies you as an individual, and any other information we associate with it. We collect a few categories of information, from a few different sources:</p>
            <br/>
            <p>1. Profile information and other content you voluntarily provide us, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User name and password</li>
                <li>Contact information when you register on our Sites, such as your name, street address, demographic information (such as your gender), age, date of birth, mobile and home phone number, and/or email address. </li>
                <li>You may also provide us information about other people, such as when you direct us to send a gift on your behalf.</li>
                <li>Any content or contributions you post in a public space on the Sites. This includes comments, videos and photos that you might submit. If you contact us through a social media site, we may collect your social media identifier.</li>
                <li>Any information you provide in communications with us, such as via social media, e-mail or our customer call center.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>2. Information that is passively collected when you use the Sites, such as by our web servers and by third party analytics tools we use:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Our system logs may record certain information about visitors to our Sites, including the web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device and mobile ad identifiers, browser information, interaction with the Sites, pages viewed, app usage, and other such information; we may collect similar information from emails you receive from us that can help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.</li>
                <li>We use certain cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to help us understand how you use the Sites and enable us to personalize your experience.  We may ask advertisers or other third party partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which rely on cookies or similar technologies placed on our Sites.</li>
                <li>We may detect the physical location of your device by, for example, using GPS information collected by mobile apps or location information shared by your web browser. We collect this information for purposes of enhancing or facilitating our services, such as enabling certain functionalities of the Sites that can provide you with information about promotions or relevant product information near you. We may use your device’s physical location to better understand how our Sites and other services and functionality are being used and to provide you with relevant and personalized location-based services and content, including advertising. Should you wish to opt out of the collection of this information, please adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings. Please note that your location may be derived from your WiFi, Bluetooth, and other device settings. Please consult your device settings for further information.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>3. We may receive information from third parties such as advertising and marketing partners, public databases, and social media platforms, to supplement the information we receive from our consumers. If we do so, this policy governs how we can use that information.</p>
             <p>4. In addition to collecting Personal Information, we may collect information that does not identify you and is not associated with your Personal Information.  We may also de-identify or anonymize information so it no longer identifies you.  We can aggregate and use such information to engage in marketing and other activities in a manner that protects our consumers since it does not use their Personal Information and is outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</p>
